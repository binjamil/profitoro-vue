# ProFitOro

ProFitOro is a Vue app that implements an effective time-management technique known as Pomodoro.

While there are many implementations of Pomodoro timer, ProFitOro stands out for one particular reason. ProFitOro will not only solve a time-management problem, but also solve a fitness-management issue. During the breaks, the app will tell you to perform simple workouts. Registered users can also personalize their workouts, timer controls and see statistics.

ProFitOro's backend database is powered by Google Firebase. It is also hosted on the same platform. You can regularly use ProFitOro to manange both your time and fitness. Here is the link: https://profitoro-3fd5a.firebaseapp.com/
